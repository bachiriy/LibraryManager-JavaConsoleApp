# Java Console Application for Library Management

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a console-based application in Java 8 to manage a municipal library's inventory and loan system. The goal is to automate library tasks, such as adding, borrowing, returning, and searching for books and magazines, using a layered architecture.

## Project Structure

### Layered Architecture

- **Presentation Layer:**
  - `ConsoleUI`: Handles the user interface.

- **Business Layer:**
  - `Document` (Abstract Class): Represents a generic library document.
  - `Book` (Class): Represents a book, inherits from `Document`.
  - `Magazine` (Class): Represents a magazine, inherits from `Document`.
  - `Library` (Class): Manages the collection of documents.

- **Utility Layer:**
  - `DateUtils`: Manages date-related operations.

### Class Details

- **Document (Abstract Class):**
  - Attributes: `id`, `titre`, `auteur`, `datePublication`, `nombreDePages`
  - Abstract Methods: `emprunter()`, `retourner()`, `afficherDetails()`

- **Book (Inherits from Document):**
  - Additional Attribute: `isbn`
  - Implements abstract methods.

- **Magazine (Inherits from Document):**
  - Additional Attribute: `numero`
  - Implements abstract methods.

## Key Features

- **Document Management:**
  - Add a document (book or magazine)
  - Borrow a document
  - Return a document
  - Display all documents
  - Search for a document

- **Technical Specifications:**
  - Use `ArrayList` for document storage
  - Implement a quick search with `HashMap<String, Document>`
  - Integrate Java Time API for date management
  - Apply lambda expressions

- **User Interface:**
  - Interactive menu with options to:
    1. Add a document
    2. Borrow a document
    3. Return a document
    4. Display all documents
    5. Search for a document
    6. Quit

## Project Constraints

- Data persists only in memory until the application is closed.
